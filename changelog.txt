IAN - 09/02
- slight formatting tweaks (mostly in 'style.css')(because I'm the neatest freak when it comes to code, you would not believe)
- changed border radius of nav to be consistent with the rest of the page
- changed colour when hovering over navbar items and other links
- changed margins and paddings in lists
- tweaked margins of <h1>, <h2>, and <h3> tags
- changed the way the widths are calculated (by giving the body margins, not giving them width)
- gave more things shadows
- gave list elements margins
- added the <main> tag because I like it (I made sure it doesnt break anything). I think it helps readability
- added the footer to the rest of the pages
- added 'basic page template.html'. It's exactly what it says on the tin
- removed that bone picture that was the icon for the skeleton page because that bone belongs to Minecraft

- 'public_events.html' scares me and I only changed one width and gave it a footer

- fought a long and bloody war against formatting
